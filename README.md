# BONA
 
 The idea behind BONA is to create a display Grotesque that has some strong heavy-ish stems but some sorta kinda less heavy on the horizonals for dat extra contrast. Impact seems like the closest relative in terms of historianics (is that a word?), but I think Coda by the late great Vernon Adams would be a much beter comparison as far as the visual metrics are concerned. 

 The concept comes from a faded sign I've happened upon, somewhere on the East Rand of Gauteng in South Africa. I might te image in the sources, but I think the overall design direction for this here project has moved beyond the initial aesthetic quality that teh sign impressed on me at about 23h45 on the way home from night out of imbibing various grain based fermented beverages.
